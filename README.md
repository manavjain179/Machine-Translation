Machine Translation is the process of translating text from one language to another which helps to reduce the conversation gap among people from different cultural backgrounds. The task performed by the Machine Translation System is to automatically translate between pairs of different natural languages, where Neural Machine Translation System stands out from all because it provides fluent translation along with reasonable translation accuracy. The Convolution Neural Network encoder is used to find patterns in the images and encode it into a vector that is passed to the Long Short Term Memory decoder which finds the caption word-by-word to best describe the image. Upon reaching the end-line token, the entire description of the image in English is generated and that is our output for that particular image. Automatically creating the description of an image in English using any natural language sentences and then translating it using Neural Machine Translation to Hindi is a very challenging task. It requires expertise in both image processing as well as natural language processing. In this project, we aim to compare the two Machine Translation Systems: Google Translation System and our Neural Machine Translation System as we convert the text obtained from an image in English to Hindi language.
